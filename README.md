# Meditation Tracker

## About
A quick and easy way to keep track of when you meditate and how you feel after. 
Once you are a user you can log the duration of your meditation session, select an icon that best represents your mood, select what type of meditation you practiced and then save all this information. 
You can look at these logs later and edit them if necessary. Keeping a meditation log is a way to strengthen your practice and observe your patterns more clearly.
